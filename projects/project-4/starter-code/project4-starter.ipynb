    "Answer: An interesting next step would be to introduce new variables and see they can help improve the results of the model. For example, we could introduce a variable that speaks to the education level of a candidate's parents. Interestingly if one's going toward a gender bias in the admission process, we could introduce a variable based on the gender of a candidate."
